### Config files to setup environment on Ubuntu

Install :

- sublime text
- pycharm
- R and Rstudio
- scala (sbt)
- kafka (with aliases!)
- some tools (htop, nbdime, setup jupyter with conda env, notebook extensions)

### Warnings

Be careful, scripts should be executed only for setup.
If something is already installed it could overwrite. 
Scripts could ask the user to confirm some action (Yes or Enter).
